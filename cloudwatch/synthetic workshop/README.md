# Cloudwatch Synthetics - Heartbeat Canary Workshop

## Introduction

You can use Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics to create canaries - configurable scripts that run on a schedule - to monitor your endpoints and APIs. Canaries check the availability and latency of your endpoints and can store load time data and screenshots of the UI as rendered by a headless Chromium browser. They monitor your REST APIs, URLs, and website content, and they can check for unauthorized changes from phishing, code injection and cross-site scripting. They can even check to see if a percentage of a web page has changed from a baseline that you establish.
