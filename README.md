# Cloudwatch Synthetics Workshop

## Introduction

AWS provides native monitoring, logging, alarming, and dashboards with Amazon CloudWatch and tracing through AWS X-Ray . When deployed together, they provide the 3 pillars (Metric, Logs & Traces) of an observability solution. The whole AWS Observability ecosystem looks like this.

For our workshop, we are going to focus on Cloudwatch Synthetics services. 

You can use Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics to create canaries - configurable scripts that run on a schedule - to monitor your endpoints and APIs. Canaries check the availability and latency of your endpoints and can store load time data and screenshots of the UI as rendered by a headless Chromium browser. They monitor your REST APIs, URLs, and website content, and they can check for unauthorized changes from phishing, code injection and cross-site scripting. They can even check to see if a percentage of a web page has changed from a baseline that you establish.

## Setup

Before we start with the lab, we need to setup few things. 
1: First we are going to setup a static website using S3.
